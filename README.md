# Instabot
Instagram Bot that comments and likes random posts based on hashtag using Python, Selenium, and webdrivers

You can change variable names for username and passwords on file secrets.py for your own account, as well as the hastag to whatever hashtag you want this bot to go though.

Note: Uses geckodriver for Firefox, so if running on your computer must need firefox.
